Itâ€™s a system that shows QR codes to itself. A screen displays them and a camera pointed at the screen is used to read them. The codes contain instructions for generating further QR codes which may also contain such instructions, creating a feedback loop. The system runs in a loop where it looks for QR codes in the camera image, then evaluates the code in them, then updates the display.

Depending on the instructions and initial conditions a variety of patterns may grow and stabilize. The system does not differentiate between codes shown on its own screen or those shown to its camera from other screens or on paper, which allows the audience to interact with the system by showing it their own QR codes.
