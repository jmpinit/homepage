<h1>Autonomous Response</h1>

<p>Edit: Now I have <a href="/blog/2025/03/26/autonomous-response-codes/">a blog
post</a> explaining this project!</p>

<p>The camera is looking for QR codes in its view. Any that are found are mapped
to into the display coordinates. The content of any detected codes is evaluated
as Lua. Various functions are made available to access information about the
environment around the code and to create new codes.</p>

<h2>Example Program</h2>

Here's a program that will create a QR code above the current one if there isn't
a code already there:
<pre>
up()
if in_qr() then
  return
end
qr(ME)
</pre>

It can be condensed somewhat by using semicolons:
<pre>
up(); if in_qr() then; return; end; qr(ME)
</pre>

<p>Here it is as a QR code that you could hold up in front of the installation to
run:</p>
