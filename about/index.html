              <h2 class="mt-5">Education</h2>
              <p>I'm largely self-taught and learning is an integral part of my day-to-day life. I started programming early and have been doing it for more than 20 years now.</p>
              <p>In 2012 I started a bachelor's degree in computer science and electrical engineering at MIT (course 6-2) and then dropped out after 2.5 years.</p>
